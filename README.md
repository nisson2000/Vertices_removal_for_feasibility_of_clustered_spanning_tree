# Vertices_removal_for_feasibility_of_clustered_spanning_tree

The Clustered Spanning Tree problem is to find a tree spanning all the vertices which satisfies that each cluster induces a subtree, when it exists. For cases when a given hypergraph does not have a feasible solution tree, we consider removing vertices from some clusters in order to gain feasibility.
